## Abstract

In this full-day workshop, you’ll learn how to build a single-page app with React. We’ll discuss the fundamentals of React development, the “React” way of building apps, and suggestions for writing maintainable React code. You’ll get hands-on experience building components, managing routes and state, styling a React app, and writing tests.

We’ll be creating an app to manage all the adorable kittens in our lives. The React landscape is extensive, and we can’t cover it all - but you’ll leave this workshop feeling confident to build your next app with React.

This session includes a healthy balance of instruction and hands-on activities. We’ll cover a broad variety of topics required to build a React app:

- React fundamentals
- Modern features of JavaScript that ease React development
- The ‘Component’ mindset
- JSX, a strange-looking hybrid between JavaScript and HTML
- Styling React components
- Routing
- State management
- A brand-new feature called hooks
- Automated testing
- Best practices

Experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required. You’ll need Git v2.15.0 or higher, NodeJS v8.9.4 or higher, NPM v5.6.0 or higher, and a text editor of your choosing.
