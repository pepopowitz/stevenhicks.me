snippet: "Work projects require git commits to be signed with my work email; I'd like commits on my personal projects to be signed with my personal email. The solution: conditional includes in my .gitconfig!"
---

My new job requires that commits in our repos are signed with our work emails. Setting the global email address is no problem:

```sh
> git config --global user.email "my.work@email.com"
```

For no important reason, other than that I believe in the sanctity and purity of a git log ([sorry, Pavlos](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/5285/commits)), I decided that I want commits in my _personal_ repos to be signed with my _personal_ email.

_Heads up:_ this isn't an article about setting up _authentication_ for two different users ‚Äî that is pretty well described in [this article about multiple SSH keys](https://code-maven.com/per-project-ssh-public-keys-git). This article is about using two different email addresses to sign commits.

## You could use repo-level .gitconfigs

The previously linked article mentions one way to use my personal email on my personal repos ‚Äî but it requires setting the local git config on each repo. This is similar to how we set it above globally:

```sh
> git config user.email "my.personal@email.com"
```

We aren't specifying `--global` here, so it's applying the configuration change to the current repo only.

This is probably a fine way to solve the problem, but I don't like the idea of having to remember to do this for every personal repo I clone. I see a very likely future where I clone a repo, make a handful of commits and push them up, then realize they were signed with my work email. üòù

## Folder-level .gitconfigs don't exist

Structurally, I keep my projects organized in a single folder that clarifies the owner: `~/dev/personal/`, vs `~/dev/camunda/`.

I'd love to be able to create one .gitconfig in the `~/dev/personal/` folder, and have it apply to all its child repos. That's not supported, unfortunately. I guess this makes sense, as it might be asking a lot for git to crawl up the tree to find all configuration files.

## Conditional git includes FTW

We can use [conditional git includes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes) to solve the problem! (h/t [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43884702))

To use a conditional git include, you specify a condition and a path to a file. If the condition is met, the file is expanded and its contents are included in your configuration.

The condition could be something like `onbranch`, to assess which branch you're currently on, or `hasconfig:remote.*.url` to look for a specific remote URL. In our case, we'll use the `gitdir` condition to assess the repo's working directory.

We'll set this up so that the global `.gitconfig` contains my work email. If a `gitdir` condition is met based on the repo's directory, a partial `.gitconfig` will override the email with my personal one.

## The final solution

My global `.gitconfig` contains my default email address, and the conditional include:

```
[user]
  name = Steven Hicks
  email = my.work@email.com
[includeIf "gitdir:~/dev/personal/"]
  path = .gitconfig-personal
```

For any repos that are inside that `~/dev/personal/` folder, the `.gitconfig-personal` file will be applied. The `.gitconfig-personal` file contains only the properties I want to override:

```
[user]
  email = my.personal@email.com
```

## Proof

You can pass a flag to `git config` to tell it to list out the current configuration: `git config -l`.

When I'm in a work directory, this emits my default email address:

```sh
‚ùØ git config -l

user.name=Steven Hicks
user.email=my.work@email.com
includeif.gitdir:~/dev/personal/.path=.gitconfig-personal
```

Note that the `includeif` shows up here, but the condition was not met, so it doesn't bring over the contents of the conditional file.

Most importantly, when I'm working in a personal repo, I see my personal email address:

```sh
‚ùØ git config -l

user.name=Steven Hicks
user.email=my.work@email.com
includeif.gitdir:~/dev/personal/.path=.gitconfig-personal
user.email=my.personal@email.com
```

It actually includes _both_ email addresses...but the last one wins, and git uses my personal email address to sign the commits.

Is this the only way to solve this problem? Likely not. If you know of another way, [let me know](https://twitter.com/pepopowitz)!
