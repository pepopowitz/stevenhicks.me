## Don't mix Andes Candies with Gummi Bears

It's easy as an expert who is leading a workshop to bombard your audience with knowledge. There are _so many cool things_ you know about your topic, and you just want to share them all with your students.

Think of it like frozen yogurt, though. When we take our kids to get froyo, they go _crazy_ for toppings. They have no regard for cohesion. They get strawberry yogurt and add Reese's Pieces, Andes Candies, Gummi Bears, and brownie bites. It's an explosion of flavors - but they taste _awful_ together.

Us adults, we craft something cohesive. Even though we love toasted coconut _and_ Andes Candies _and_ raspberries, we wouldn't dare put them all in the same dish.

Treat your workshop content in the same way. Each lesson should build on the previous. Not every concept needs to be taught - find the ones that fit together. Cut out the Gummi Bears if you're going for a mint/white chocolate vibe; skip the performance analysis if you're going for an intro to building an app.

Remember that the workshop is not about you, or the things that you know - it's about the awesome people who came to learn from you.
