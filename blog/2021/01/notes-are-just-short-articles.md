snippet: In my head I created a distinction between long content and short content. I think the distinction is really there, but I don't think it warrants separate communication channels.

After writing about [lowering my personal bar for new content](/blog/2021/01/lowering-the-bar/), I spent some time setting up a second "channel" of content on my site for notes.

The next day I read [this article from Zach Leatherman about retiring a Notes section](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1353075180415799300) and it gave me pause:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retired the Notes section of my web site and rolled all of the content into the main blog.<br><br>If Iâ€™m being honest with myself, I think I implemented this because I felt like everything that went into my blog needed to be super polished. Iâ€™m outgrowing this feeling ðŸ˜… <a href="https://t.co/qSfBmJJpJZ">https://t.co/qSfBmJJpJZ</a></p>&mdash; Zach Leatherman (@zachleat) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1353075180415799300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This morning, my coworker [Pavlos](https://twitter.com/pvinis) shared [an article on naming schemes](https://pvin.is/post/my-device-naming-scheme), and while I was on his site I noticed he'd shared [what inspired him to start writing more regularly](https://pvin.is/post/ok-ok-ill-start). What inspired me the most was the brevity of this post, and others â€” some of his articles are longer, but many are also very short. Almost like what I was going to call the "Notes" section of my site.

Sooooo I've ripped out the incomplete Notes section. Everything I write is just going to be an article, and there's no reason they have to be long. I wanted to put classification around how long something would take to read. I still think there is a distinction between short and long content â€” I just don't think it warrants separate channels.
