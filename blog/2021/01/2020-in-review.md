The 2020 we deserved but didn't get: https://twitter.com/pepopowitz/status/1335637959983370242

## TL;DR

My goals coming into 2020 were: 

- Continue to find balance and do more of the things most important to me.
- Get better at dealing with intense but important conversations.
- Run a marathon or longer on trail.

I accomplished all three!

But 2020 was way more complex than these three goals. It was kind of a four-act play for me: 

**Act 1:** I felt like I was crushing it early in the year.
**Act 2:** Ummmmm I don't know if you remember this but we had a global pandemic and racial injustice crisis last year. 
**Act 3:** I curled into a ball and focused on self-care.
**Act 4:** My health-meter filled back up and I feel like I'm crushing it again.

There were some definite personal successes for me in 2020. I hesitate to celebrate them without first acknowledging the privilege I have in writing an article about 2020 that doesn't once involve my life, livelihood, or humanity being threatened. 

Okay you made it this far, might as well read along for the entire ride!

## Act 1: Feeling pretty good

### No more tech lead

I started 2020 by stepping down from a tech lead position at [Artsy](artsy). For a lot of people this would feel bad, but for me it felt amazing. I thought a lot about how I enjoyed spending my time as an engineer and how I didn't, and I found that being a tech lead *prevented* me from doing the things I wanted to do. I envisioned the role including a lot of pairing, unblocking, and mentoring, but really it was more about strategy, planning, and to be blunt, meetings. It was scary to step down only months after getting the opportunity but doing so enabled me to do more of the pairing/unblocking/mentoring that I'd looked forward to. 

### CodeMash 2020

One of my favorite recent traditions has been speaking at CodeMash in early January. I got to teach a full room about Test Driven Development with JavaScript: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Packed room for <a href="https://twitter.com/pepopowitz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pepopowitz</a>â€™ workshop on TDD with Jest.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeveloperCommunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeveloperCommunity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeMash?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CodeMash</a> #@codemash <a href="https://t.co/7p6ZcEc2LM">pic.twitter.com/7p6ZcEc2LM</a></p>&mdash; Chris | Dev Advocate (@saltnburnem) <a href="https://twitter.com/saltnburnem/status/1214925956902785024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I also got to repeat my fave CodeMash activity â€” drinking beers in a hot tub with [Cory House](cory-house) and [Victor](https://twitter.com/vforvidane)...geez Victor, you're one of my favorite reasons to go to CodeMash and I don't know your last name. I miss this a lot this year.

### Some local speaking

I knew with my intentional focus on myself & my family that I wouldn't be speaking at many conferences, so I focused on speaking at local meetups. I talked about how we're using [Cypress](cypress) at [Artsy](artsy) a few times â€” including once in Chicago, right before things shut down around here. My friend [Ben](ben) skipped work to take the train down with me. I didn't know what I was doing and made us take the sloooooooowwwww train. I think this is the last time I went to a bar. 

### Writing

TODO: cypress & goto articles

### Meditation streak

I hit a 30-day streak for meditation! I'd wanted to do this for years but I'm the kind of person who finds routines to be sooooooo booooring so this was really hard. 

Not surprisingly, once the pandemic hit I basically stopped meditating. Maybe more surprisingly, I haven't really picked it up since. It's okay, though â€” I've discovered that running/cycling are *better* than meditation for me, so I just make sure to do them once a day instead.

## Act 2: FFFFFFFffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu what just happened?

And then it became apparent that COVID-19 was a real thing. Everything shut down, including the trail marathon I'd signed up for. 

And then it became apparent that our country was built on a rigged, unfair foundation. TODO: something else here

And health problems, woof. I got wrecked by a large kidney stone â€” my wife had to drop me off at the ER at 2am, I stumbled in doubled over in pain, and she drove off because that's all she could do. My aunt (unsuccessfully) battled cancer. My mom (successfully) battled cancer and an aneurysm. 

What a mess. 

### Speaking

I tried speaking at online events. It was really hard to connect with people. I'll speak virtually again for events that are meaningful to me, but I don't intend on spending a lot of time speaking until it's possible in person again. To be honest, I'm not even sure I'll put a lot of time into it _then_, either. This part of me might have broken. 

### Writing

I had a hard time finding inspiration and motivation to write, too. I did find a bit of outlet on Twitter, though.

I wrote up some really good remote work tips: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remote working tips that no one seems to want to talk about:</p>&mdash; Steven Hicks (@pepopowitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/pepopowitz/status/1237574431855087616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And "this one neat trick" for falling asleep when your mind doesn't want you to: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An article came up for me in my news aggregator about &quot;this amazing one trick that will help you fall asleep in minutes.&quot; The trick was basically (1) lay down, (2) calm down, and (3) fall asleep.

And a summary of how I use [Todoist](todoist) to manage my day (when I'm successful at managing my day): 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlanciaux?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ryanlanciaux</a> convinced me to finally write up my thoughts about how I use <a href="https://twitter.com/todoist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@todoist</a> to manage my day. <a href="https://t.co/GDhmhpOMir">https://t.co/GDhmhpOMir</a><br><br>So....a (very verbose) thread ðŸ‘‡</p>&mdash; Steven Hicks (@pepopowitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/pepopowitz/status/1261323105479331841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

mtfm community vs blogging for devs
- decided i do better with communities of people i actually know

- read a book about being a better listener and got better at listening without judgement


## Act 4: I can't control the wind or the waves but I can steer the ship

- ash leaves
- hooollly f I'm part of the culture
- tell my boss I want to spend more time doing non-product work
  - if I'd leave artsy it'd be to do something in advocacy
  - but why can't I just do that at artsy?
- ask permission like 15 times
- start a podcast
- take over writing office hours & stick to it
- stick to relay peer learning group


Act 1: 

## Tech Community
