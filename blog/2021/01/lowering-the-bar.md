Today I'm thinking about lowering the bar for content creation by embracing smallness. Often when I want to create something it becomes *huge* in my mind, and I don't deliver it because I lose interest before achieving the grandiosity. 

Maybe I can break ideas up into smaller pieces. Whereas my instinct is to write an article with all 7 tips for ____, maybe I can release 7 articles 1 at a time. This would tighten the feedback loop of writing & getting public feedback. It might also remind people that I'm actively writing, rather than thinking I've dropped off the face of the earth again. 

This parallels a thing in software product management â€” slice stories small so that you can release & iterate faster. 

Maybe this starts with me actually releasing this writing warmup as a "note" on my website. "Notes" will be lighter-weight, shorter reads.
