# Where am I?

Here's where you can find me on the internet -- in rough order of most active to least active.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pepopowitz): I am in GitHub many many times every day.
- [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@pepopowitz): This is my main! Posts about tech, triathlon stuff, art stuff, etc. I like it better than Mastodon. But it's not very active yet. I check this a couple times daily.
- [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@pepopowitz): This used to be my main. Posts about tech, triathlon stuff, art stuff, etc. I check this once daily.
- [YouTube](www.youtube.com/@2RadDads): 2RadDads, a programming stream I do with my friend Jon! It's pretty active, except when Jon and I are on summer vacations.
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stevenjhicks/): All tech/job posts. I'm more active lately, usually posting about 2RadDads.
- [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/a-developer-experience): My podcast about being a human in tech -- A Developer Experience Podcast. It's currently dormant until winter.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pepopowitz/): Mostly non-tech posts.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pepopowitz): I'm paused here. I don't support the current ownership, and I'm only engaging if you engage me directly.
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/pepopowitz): Syndicated blog posts from here, but not all of them.

And of course you can always try to reach me at [steven.j.hicks@gmail.com](mailto:steven.j.hicks@gmail.com), and I'll do my best, though I am often the kind of person to ignore emails until it becomes too uncomfortable to respond.
