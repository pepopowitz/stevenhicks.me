# Where am I?

Here's where you can find me on the internet -- in rough order of most active to least active.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pepopowitz): I am in GitHub many many times every day.
- [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@pepopowitz): This is my main! Posts about tech, triathlon stuff, art stuff, etc. I wish Threads was more active. I check this a couple times daily.
- [YouTube](www.youtube.com/@2RadDads): 2RadDads, a programming stream I do with my friend Jon! It's pretty active, except when Jon and I are on vacations or busy with dad stuff.
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stevenjhicks/): All tech/job posts. I'm more active lately, usually posting about 2RadDads. I probably won't accept a connection request unless I've met you in person.
- [Podcast](https://anchor.fm/a-developer-experience): My podcast about being a human in tech -- A Developer Experience Podcast -- is dormant. I do plan to revive it soon, under a new name. But the old episodes are still pretty good and you should listen to them.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pepopowitz/): Mostly non-tech posts.
- [Email](mailto:steven.j.hicks@gmail.com): Yes, I'll definitely get your email. Will I respond? ðŸ¤· I wish I could say that I was not the kind of person who forgets to respond to an email until it becomes too uncomfortable to respond.....but I am that person.
- [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@pepopowitz): This used to be my main, but I don't really like the idea of infinite walled gardens. I'm basically dormant here, unless you engage me directly.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pepopowitz): I'm paused here. I don't support the current ownership, and I'm only engaging if you engage me directly.
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/pepopowitz): Syndicated blog posts from here, but not all of them.
