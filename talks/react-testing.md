## Abstract

Congratulations! You’re building a sweet new web application with React. But what are you doing for unit testing?

Setting your environment up for JavaScript unit testing can be intimidating. React tooling is phenomenal though, and makes setup a breeze. In this session, we’ll look at how to get started writing tests for your React app. We’ll dig into the features of Jest as a test-runner and test framework. Then we’ll take a look at Enzyme, a framework for testing your React components directly. Finally, we’ll look at guidance and best practices. What should you test? When should you test it? How can you keep your React code friendly to unit tests?

You will leave this session ready to cover your React app with tests.
