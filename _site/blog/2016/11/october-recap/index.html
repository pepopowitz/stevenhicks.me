Aside from being peak soccer season for my kids, I spoke at Milwaukee Code Camp on the 15th, and MKE DOT NET at the end of the month.</p>
<p>First off, thanks to everyone who attended my sessions! I had a great time. I really enjoy the storytelling part of speaking. It is quickly becoming clear to me that stories are how you draw people in.</p>
<h2>Milwaukee Code Camp</h2>
<p>At Milwaukee Code Camp, I presented my static site/JAM stack talk, in the &quot;Backends? Where we're going we don't need...backends...&quot; iteration. This talk has undergone constant revision since I first gave it, as I've been learning how to do technical speaking. It will change before the next time, too. I had some great feedback from people, and I also noticed some things on my own that I am looking forward to improving.</p>
<p>I battled some issues with the projector right as my talk was about to start. While I was waiting for help to arrive, I decided that I could get started without slides - and realized before help arrived that I could probably do this talk entirely without a projector. This was an encouraging feeling.</p>
<h2>MKE DOT NET</h2>
<p>After Milwaukee Code Camp, the crazy ramped even higher. Aside from speaking at MKE DOT NET, I was also fairly involved in helping organize the conference. The end of October was a crazy busy time. Thankfully, I work with a ton of really great people who volunteered to make the event run silky smooth, given some scheduling challenges from the venue.</p>
<p>My talk at MKE DOT NET almost couldn't have gone better. I had a great crowd, including some old friends. Everyone seemed really engaged - at one point I wanted to take a picture of literally the entire crowd looking up at a code sample, but the moment had passed by the time I got my phone out.</p>
<p>Slides for this talk can be found <a href="https://steven-j-hicks-speaking.netlify.com/code-is-communication/">here</a>.</p>
<p>One experiment from this talk that went really well was the use of a JavaScript-based presentation framework, instead of PowerPoint. I find that I spend a lot of time moving things around in PowerPoint, and I really wanted something where I could use CSS to keep my slides consistent. I also wanted to be able to keep my slides in a git repo. I did a little research and found that <a href="https://remarkjs.com">remark</a> most closely met the vision in my head.</p>
<p>It worked great! My plan moving forward is to use remark to build all my decks. I am not the biggest fan of markdown but I love being able to outline my talk in code, and build it out from there.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great conversations I got out of these two events, but right up near the top was an opportunity to work with Scott Hanselman to prepare the A/V equipment for his keynote. I got some great tips from him on speaking, as well as making MKE DOT NET more diverse next year.</p>

<h2>Up Next</h2>
<p>My next scheduled talk will be at QA Camp in Milwaukee, on December 8th. I'll be speaking with a colleague on tightening the feedback loop with TDD and DevOps.</p>
<p>I've also got a couple proposals that I'm awaiting responses from, and I'm looking forward to submitting to as many CFPs as I can in the near future.</p>
